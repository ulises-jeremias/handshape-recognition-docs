#  to do list for the first version of the paper for cacic2019

# weak points of the paper to address in a future iteration

1.  need to include more datasets to make a comparison
2.   should employ pretrained networks  to compare, because  transfer learning is a really easy way  to compensate for the lack of data
3.    should employ semi-labeling techniques to take advantage of unlabeled hands
4.     should try to merge different datasets
5.      the data augmentation techniques are limited,  should explore a bit more which type of data augmentation helps the model
