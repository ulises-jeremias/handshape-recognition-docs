#  to do list for the first version of the paper for cacic2019

1. replace the table with the results with  varying sample sizes with three plots, one for each data set, where the x axis is the percentage of  samples used and the y-axis is the accuracy obtained. use different colors for each model, and different line types for the data augmented versions.

5.   the images of the samples of the data sets are quite  blurred
6.   eval dense net (bets growth rate 32?)

 # weak points of the paper to address in a future iteration

 1.  need to include more datasets to make a comparison
 2.   should employ pretrained networks  to compare, because  transfer learning is a really easy way  to compensate for the lack of data
 3.    should employ semi-labeling techniques to take advantage of unlabeled hands
 4.     should try to merge different datasets
 5.      the data augmentation techniques are limited,  should explore a bit more which type of data augmentation helps the model
