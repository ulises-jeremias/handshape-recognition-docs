We have performed experiments to evaluate the mean accuracy of Prototypical Networks and DenseNet on three handshape recognition datasets with and without data augmentation techniques.
For all datasets we found models that showed a performance on par with the state of the art.

Taking the obtained results into account, everything seems to indicate that DenseNet usually has very good results in general for handshape recognition datasets. However, Prototypical Networks shows to be a better option in those datasets where the hand images are segmented as shown in the accuracy obtained on LSA16 and CIARP datasets.

In future work, we will focus in...
